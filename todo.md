## Current Priorities
- Clarify the requirement for the "Cursor hook" (scope, trigger, and expected automation) while adhering to the Context7 usage constraint.
- Survey existing developer tooling (scripts, configs) in the repo to see where a new hook or automation should live.
- Design and implement the hook so that it updates or prompts for tests after function edits, runs the relevant test suite, and reports/fixes failures if possible.
- Plan for how test files should be updated automatically (naming conventions, locations) in line with repository testing policies.
- Document usage instructions and integration steps for the new hook so teammates can adopt it.
