Before shipping UI changes:\n- Confirm client vs server component; include \"use client\" when hooks/state are used\n- Keep strings localized via messages/i18n; update translations if keys change\n- Accessibility: semantic elements, aria labels, keyboard/tab order, focus states, color contrast\n- Testing selectors: data-testid coverage for E2E/regression flows\n- Responsive and error/loading states validated\n- Run pnpm typecheck, pnpm lint, targeted Jest (tests/active), pnpm test:e2e --workers=1 when UX flows touched (start dev server per TEST_RUNNING_INSTRUCTIONS.md)\n- Note any doc or screenshot updates needed"
