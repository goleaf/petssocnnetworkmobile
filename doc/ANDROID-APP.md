# Android App Generation Guide

PawSocial is a **Next.js Progressive Web App (PWA)** that can be installed on Android devices. You have multiple options for deploying it as an Android app:

## üéØ Recommended Approach: PWA (Progressive Web App)

The easiest and most maintainable approach is to deploy PawSocial as a PWA that users can install directly from their Android browser.

### ‚úÖ What's Already Set Up

1. **PWA Manifest** (`app/manifest.ts`) - Defines app metadata, icons, and behavior
2. **Mobile-optimized UI** - Responsive design built with TailwindCSS
3. **Touch-friendly interface** - All components optimized for mobile interaction
4. **Offline capability** - Ready for service worker integration

### üì± How Users Install on Android

Users can install PawSocial on their Android device in two ways:

#### Option 1: From Chrome Browser
1. Open `https://your-domain.com` in Chrome
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" or "Install" banner
3. Tap "Add" or "Install"
4. App appears as an icon on the home screen

#### Option 2: Manual Add to Home Screen
1. Open Chrome menu (three dots)
2. Select "Add to Home Screen"
3. Confirm the installation
4. App launches like a native app

### üöÄ Deploying Your PWA

#### Step 1: Build for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

#### Step 2: Deploy to Hosting

**Option A: Vercel (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

**Option B: Netlify**
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

**Option C: Any Static Hosting**
- Upload the `.next` folder or static export
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA)

#### Step 3: Generate Proper Icons

Replace placeholder icons with actual app icons:

```bash
# You need 192x192 and 512x512 PNG icons
# Place them in public/ directory:
# - icon-192x192.png
# - icon-512x512.png
# - apple-icon.png (optional, for iOS)
```

Use tools like:
- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
- [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator)
- [Maskable.app](https://maskable.app/editor)

## ü§ñ Alternative: Native Android App with Capacitor

If you need deeper Android integration (push notifications, native device APIs, Play Store distribution), you can wrap the Next.js app with Capacitor.

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio installed
- Java JDK 17+
- Android SDK configured

### Setup Steps

#### 1. Install Capacitor

```bash
pnpm add @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android
```

#### 2. Initialize Capacitor

```bash
npx cap init "PawSocial" "com.pawsocial.app"
```

#### 3. Add Android Platform

```bash
npx cap add android
```

#### 4. Configure Next.js for Static Export

Create `next.config.mjs` with static export:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  assetPrefix: '',
  basePath: '',
}

export default nextConfig
```

#### 5. Build and Sync

```bash
# Build Next.js static export
pnpm build

# Copy built files to Capacitor
npx cap copy android

# Sync Capacitor plugins
npx cap sync android
```

#### 6. Open in Android Studio

```bash
npx cap open android
```

#### 7. Build APK/AAB

In Android Studio:
1. Build ‚Üí Generate Signed Bundle / APK
2. Select Android App Bundle (AAB) for Play Store
3. Or APK for direct installation
4. Follow signing wizard

#### 8. Configure App Details

Edit `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
- App name, icon, permissions
- Deep linking configuration
- Splash screen

Edit `android/app/build.gradle`:
- Version code and name
- Package name
- Min/target SDK versions

## üîÑ Alternative: React Native (For Advanced Needs)

If you need a fully native experience with custom native modules, consider creating a React Native app and reusing components.

### When to Use React Native
- Custom native camera integration
- Advanced image processing
- Hardware-specific features
- Maximum performance needs

### Setup
```bash
npx create-expo-app PawSocialMobile --template
# Migrate shared components from Next.js
# Implement native navigation and APIs
```
